[Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/) is a web challenge based upon a advent calendar but for developers.

Every day a challenge to solve. No programming language imposed.

My solutions can be found [here](https://mtouzot.github.io/advents-of-code/)

## Requirements

This project will as long as possible avoid the use of external Python module.

It uses [`aocd`](https://github.com/wimglenn/advent-of-code-data) module developped by [Wim Jeantine-Glenn](https://github.com/wimglenn). Don't forget do install it in a virtual environment to launch the scripts.

However it will use Python >= 3.12 features. You can download it from the [official website](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
